# EEEE2065-CW3
A text based adventure game that was created as part of an assignment.
The base code of the game which involved 4 rooms, 1 monster, and picking artifcats were developed along
with the lecturer during class.
Additional features of the game implemented were additional rooms, monsters, dropping weapons and artifacts,
locking doors, and other functions which were not part of the base code.

## Future Improvements:
- Create a single class that can process all kill Monster functions
- Improve code modularity by introducing inheritance into the classes
